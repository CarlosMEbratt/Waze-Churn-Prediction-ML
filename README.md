## The Challenge: Predicting User Churn in the Waze App

Imagine yourself navigating a bustling city with ease, thanks to Waze's free navigation app. Waze prides itself on its vibrant community that contributes to a safer and more efficient driving experience for everyone. But what if some users stop using the app altogether? This is where user churn comes in.
<br/>

**The purpose** is to build a model to predict which users are most likely to peace out of the app within a month.

But this isn't just about keeping users happy (although that's important too!). This model is a key to unlocking some seriously cool insights. We're talking:
<br/>
* Spotting users at risk of churning: Imagine being able to identify users who might ditch the app before they do. Then Waze can swoop in with special offers or features to keep them on board â€“ win-win!
* Figuring out "why" users churn: This model can basically tell us what's pushing users away. Armed with that knowledge, Waze can improve the app and make the whole experience even better.
* Data-powered decisions: With churn prediction in our back pocket, Waze leadership can make strategic calls about keeping users engaged and allocating resources efficiently.<br/>

Basically, my project is about giving Waze the tools to keep users happy, improve the app, and ultimately grow their business. So, are you ready to see how data analysis can help Waze keep users cruising on the right track? Let's dive in!
