🚗 Waze User Churn Prediction using Machine Learning
This project builds a predictive model to identify which users are likely to stop using the Waze app. By analyzing behavioral and demographic patterns, it aims to help retain users by detecting churn risk early.

🎯 Project Objective
Predict user churn based on historical usage data and user characteristics. The goal is to support targeted retention strategies by identifying high-risk users before they stop using the app.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Workflow
Data Exploration & Visualization

Reviewed user demographics and behavioral patterns (e.g., frequency, engagement).

Used bar plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps for visual insights.

Preprocessing

Converted categorical variables to numerical.

Normalized and cleaned the dataset.

Handled imbalanced data with resampling (if applicable).

Modeling

Applied multiple classifiers: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

Performed cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

Results

Identified key predictors of churn (e.g., reduced usage frequency, certain account types).

Final model showed strong classification performance and generalization capability.

📌 Key Insights
Users with declining usage over time are more likely to churn.

Engagement-based features were highly predictive.

The churn prediction model could be embedded into marketing systems for retention targeting.

🔄 Future Enhancements
Deploy as a web dashboard to monitor churn scores in real time.

Integrate SHAP values for explainability.

Fine-tune with temporal behavior data for more accurate modeling.
